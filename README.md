# Metal Ilness In Tech Employees
Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in largedata sets involving
methods at the intersection ofmachine learning,statistics, anddatabase systems. An
essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns. It is
aninterdisciplinary subfield ofcomputer science. The overall goal of the data mining
process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable
structure for further use.
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large
quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of
data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies
(association rule mining,sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database
techniques such asspatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary
of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine
learning andpredictive analytics
In this project I am trying to measure and visualize attitudes towards mental health and
frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace along with analysis of What
are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards
mental health in the workplace.
